The WOD I worked on last was Invoice1. In this WOD, the goal was to display a table that displayed a list of information about different products. Additionally, all of the names and values had to be represented as variables, instead of hard-coded into the page. The WOD page is https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html. 

This WOD wasn't very hard to do, as this was one of the ones I was able to do first try. However, this was my first WOD where I slowed down to an Av pace, which speaks to the amount of tedious busywork involved in this. The process of making everything is very easy, just declaring about 40 variables and putting them in their respective place in the table. However, the process of renaming about 20 of them was a big slowdown, as well as putting all of them in their respective place in the table. Regardless, I'd take easy work I can easily understand over a "short" lab question that is suddenly changed to be on your own.

Like every other WOD, I looked up resources on W3Schools and attempted to do the WOD first with guidance. W3Schools thankfully has a great tutorial about tables, which would be the only thing that might be hard to remember due to only ever using it once. Other than that, I just cruised, which was a nice change of pace.

I suppose to be better prepared, I'd do parts of the WOD myself with guidance to make sure I can do it even faster, or do it in a warmer environment so my hands didn't keep going semi-numb mid-WOD. I don't think it was necessary to be better prepared for this WOD in particular, however.
