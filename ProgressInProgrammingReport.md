My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: First of all, my skills in interpreting code have improved. I can troubleshoot a lot better than before what went wrong, and for what reasons. Assignment 1 made me look at a lot of code and wonder why it did what it did. In turn, when something went wrong, I could tell where was wrong, even if I didn't know exactly how to fix it. I unfortunately can't think of any other way that I've notably improved from before, but I feel that the one trait alone is an excellent skill to have, as knowing where to work is always the first step in fixing an error. 

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills: I need to gain more proficiency in knowing what specific symbols mean in different contexts ([], {}, $, etc.), as thinking of a different use case for one when I needed to use something else ends up with me stuck, not knowing why my code isn't working. Additionally, I really need to improve my ability to write functions, as they are incredibly useful with repeating vital and common code in applications.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast: I have, and I did, as I practically never copied directly from the screencast. I remember using a frame of one as a reference to see how I need to structure my WOD to keep it functioning, but most of my references came from W3Schools.

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence: The labs have helped a bit less, as I feel like the structure they have between how they are done in class and what we are given to do at home does not help me get a lot of the material presented. The first 30 minutes of class most days are spent explaining the concept. While it is useful to teach about the background and applications of the topic, it doesn't give crucial time to explaining the first-hand implementation of such functions, making labs less about messing around with the code to understand it, and just trying to keep up with the pace of copying everything done on screen. Additionally, all of the work given for the On Your Own section is usually the most complicated material, which works only if everyone completely understands the material covered before. If I were to try to complete all of the labs on my own now, I would surely get stuck with one of the OYO sections of latest labs due to this.

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2: Assignment 1 helped me learn a lot, and gave me a sense of what the baseline is supposed to be like at this point in the semester. I'm glad there was an assignment like this that is just a culmination of everything that we have done before. As for if I'm ready to work on Assignment 2, I need to take a good look at it first. By how the first one went, and the material in the labs that we are currently going over, I'd say I'm mostly ready to continue.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways: Besides the suggestions already made above, I believe that the steps that have been made to improve this class from the semesters before (from what I've heard) have worked very well to improve the QoL for all the students in the class. I'll use this section instead to appreciate those changes, like the active presense on Discord that existed to help the students, the class recordings (even if I didn't use them), and how much the schedule was brought up in class, to keep the students informed even if they didn't look for themselves.

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.): I think the greatest sources of help for me are the readings and assistance from anyone that would answer my signals for help, be it the professor, TA's, or other students.
