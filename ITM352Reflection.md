**Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:**
Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context

  Smartphone Products taught me the skills needed in HTML and CSS to look at a webpage and know why it looks the way it does. This also gave me a hint of how to make pages look like specific things if requested. The use of animations and how the slider affects them are an example of how to give personality to a web page.
  
Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge

  There wasn't so much a specific assignment that taught me this as much as just going through the class in general did. Hearing about all of the different features and how they can be applied, from basic webpage formatting in HTML to how to store and transfer data with cookies, all of it made me think of how services that already exist utilize them.
  
Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications

  Assignment 1 was the first real hands-on experience, with only general guidelines to point us in the right direction. The use of outside templates of our own choosing and implementation of client and server interaction really felt like we were making something that didn't exist before, instead of just following directions. 
  
Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions

  I experienced problems as early as the Browser History 2 WOD. However, when a problem occured, and I was stuck in my tracks at the WOD, I stopped my attempt and looked back at the material to figure out what everything did again. After some searching, and trial and error outside of the WOD, I was able to figure out why my images weren't showing up, and why my page wasn't formatted correctly.
  
Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues

  While I never did work in a team or really manage anything besides myself during the semester, Assignment 2 definitely gave me a lot of issues when it came to developing the right features. Problems like moving the products through the login or registration screens to the invoice and fixing why supposedly stored data wasn't being used once invoked took a bit of time and thinking to solve.
  
Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems

  Assignment 2 also gave me some confidence when it came to my own ability to intuit how to implement specific features, like how to get more than just the email in the query string, or how to make validations for each entered field on the login and registration pages. When approaching these problems, I literally stood up from my computer and started pacing, thinking to myself on where the data is, what needs to be done to it, and where it needs to go.


**Course Elements and Personal Engagement**

What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?

  I learned that it is suprisingly easy to created a professional portfolio for yourself. Since it wasn't use too much, however, I didn't learn much else.
  
What did you gain from doing the WODs?

  I gained reinforcement for my method of preparing to do the WOD before actually doing it. Looking at the material and making sure I understand both what it does and exactly how to implement it was necessary for meeting my own standards for the time limits given.
  
Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?

  The quizzes were sometimes useful, but the specificity of the answers made me think more about exact syntax rather than application, which helped with the parts we did in class, but not on our own.
  
What did you learn from doing the labs?

  The labs weren't the most useful things in their current state, though as concepts got more complicated and more time was spent on implementation rather than possible application, I learned both when we would use and how we would use the concept. Near the end, when going over the last couple topics, attentive listening helped me to know when and how I would use them in my own assignments.
  
What did you learn from doing the essays?

  I didn't learn, so much as value the chance it gave us to reflect on what we have done, both successfully and unsuccessfully. These were a good way to consider how we approached different parts of the class, and how we could have done things differently in hindsight.
  
What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?

  I learned the majority of how to actually apply what I did previously, as the first two assignments touched on nearly everything previously covered and more. The main thing I learned, however, was my method to approaching problems. Like I said before, taking a step back and thinking about the application, implementation, and execution of ideas helped immensely with feature implementation.


**Challenges and Achievements**

Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.

  Some specific challenges I encountered was re-learning CSS, generating tables with loops, and implementing the users_logged_in array and all capabilities associated with it in my Assignment 2.
  
Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.

  My previously mentioned strategy that I formed and developed over the course of the class really came in handy near the end, as it was a result of preparing for the WODs. I will talk more about a specific example of this in the question below.
  
Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.

  There were numerous moments over the course of the class when I was working on solving an issue, then after stepping back and thinking about a problem, I come up with an implementable solution while pacing around the rest of my house. The most notable example was during Assignment 2, where I had to do this multiple times. Once for the login and registration validations, another time for holding quantities information in storage, and a final time for implementing the users_logged_in array to keep track of how many users are logged in.
  

**Skill Development and Application**

Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.

  My progression towards the syntatic part was somewhat rough, as it was a while since I took ICS 101 and did not have any other coding experience. The refresher on HTML wasn't too bad, but I am still not too confident in my ability to use CSS to design a web page to look the way I'd like it to. Thankfully, templates can solve that issue. For the algorithmic portion, it started get a bit more difficult, as I was completely unfamiliar with functions, and there were a lot of terms being used that I wasn't able to fully keep track of at the time. Finally, application was quite difficult, as I wasn't fully over the algorithmic portion yet. However, with a bit of concentrated effort, I was able to get a decent grasp on the rest of it, and actually implementing it wasn't very hard for me.
  
Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.

  The portion of this above that talks about significant achievements or milestones covers this topic perfectly, as it is also about my hands-on experience with web based e-service applications.


**Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)**

Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.

  I didn't use generative AI much, as believe it or not, I had never used it prior to this sememster. All of a sudden, I had multiple classes mentioning it like it was just accepted as some sort of "inevitable tool," that we already have had prior training to use. The most that something like CoPilot helped me was as a glorified search engine.
  
Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.

  I did turn to CoPilot in vain a few times during this class (after failing certain WODs or looking at how to implement a feature like regular expressions), but didn't use it frequently as it didn't give me much to work with that a search engine could not.


**Future Implications and Professional Growth**

Explore how the skills and knowledge gained from ITM 352 can be applied in your future academic and professional endeavors.
  The skills of how to approach and solve problems can be used towards any application-based topic that I do not intuitively understand at first. These problems can range from how and when to apply specific formulas on an exam, to how to avoid traffic on the way to work, to how to approach a particularly hard to work with student/client/coworker. Going over what you know, everything you can do with it, and how to utilize it to solve a problem is a great skill that was honed by how difficult this class was compared to most for me.
  
Discuss the potential impacts these skills will have on your career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems.

  Besides simply having the capability to solve more problems on my own, I also will be able to make sure I understand the needs of whoever needs my MIS services, in order to know how I need (or to tell others to) go about implementing a solution that addresses it. 
  
Reflect on the overall value of the course in your educational journey and future career.

  The course marked an important first step into my major, and shows that I need to take it seriously, as it won't be nearly as easy as what came before it. However, the focus on application instead of memorization is very fresh, and something that I enjoy thinking about. This will help my ability to apply what I know, and how enthauastic I am about crafting solutions to problems I am given to solve.
