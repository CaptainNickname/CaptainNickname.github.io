Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
Assignment 2 was based on the concept of taking what store we had in Assignment 1, and adding the functionality of logging in/registering users before they purchased goods. Here is a link to Assignment 2: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html and the questions page: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html.

What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned how to store values between multiple pages, how to utilize regular expressions, and how to use function parameters to validate data. 

Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I did not work with a partner, so I did 100% of the work.

How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
When I needed help, I looked up information online, using mainly W3Schools to find different functions I needed (like the match() function), and occationally looked into StackExchange forums about coding in Javascript to see examples for other actual programs, rather than the W3Schools code which is very obviously just a demonstration. I needed help with finding certain features to do certain tasks, mainly the aforementioned match() parameters and regex, but I had the most trouble on implementing my IR, which was to keep track of how many users were logged in, increment it whenever somebody logged in, and adding a logout button so people could log out and decrement the counter.

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
This assignment was a lot more about thinking about how to do something, and less about writing a large amount of code. A lot of thought was given into where to have information, what purpose it serves, and where it needed to go.

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I'd say about 35% of the time was spent thinking about how to do something (or just pacing around to steady my thoughts), 5% of the time was writing code, and 60% of the time was spent testing and debugging issues.

Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
The main thing I can credit myself for during this assignment is thinking about what type of information is needed to perform certain tasks, and how to obtain it (and send it to where you need it, if necessary). Addtionally, focusing on keeping a steady head helped with not becoming too distraught, which would have distracted me from creating functions or solving problems. What was probably the largest help was the template and initial screencast, which very much helped with my main weakness, which I will discuss next. The main thing that harmed me was my inexperience with how to write code that obtains information, and how to pass that information along.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
The only thing I would do dfifferently would be to not spend one more day (the Sunday before it was due, specifically) working on it, as I had plenty of free time I used for leisure. Instead, I worked for nearly 9 hours straight the day before it was due to complete the back 2/3 of the assignment.
