Hello, my name is Nicholas Yasuda. I am studying for a B.B.A. in MIS at the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I was born and raised in Waikiki, on O'ahu, Hawaii. My hobbies include reading, listening to music, and playing video games. 
My initial reason for becoming an MIS major was my father's whim, but I have since looked into the field and found it is an extremely useful field to go into due to the generalist purpose of the skills introduced by being an MIS major. The idea of being the bridge between business and technology seemed very fitting for myself. Additionally, being able to tactically ultiize software to solve problems seems like an extremely practical skill to have, both in and out of business.
